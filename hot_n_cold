D                A
You change your mind
        Em             G
Like a girl changes clothes
     D     A
Yeah you, PMS
         Em
Like a bitch
         G
I would know
     D         A
And you over think
         Em
Always speak
    G
Crypticly
          D
I should know
      A                 Em   G
That you're no good for me



{CHORUS}
              D              
Cause you're hot then you're cold
        A
You're yes then you're no
        Em
You're in then you're out
        G
You're up then you're down
       D
You're wrong when it's right
     A
It's black and it's white
   Em
We fight, we break up
   G
We kiss, we make up
     D                          A
(you)You don't really want to stay, no
         Em                           G
(but you)But you don't really want to go-o
       D
You're hot then you're cold
       A
You're yes then you're no
       Em
You're in and you're out
       G
You're up and you're down


D           A
We used to be
           Em
Just like twins
       G
So in sync
     D       A
The same energy
         Em       G
Now's a dead battery
        D            A
Used to laugh bout nothing
         Em       G
Now your plain boring
          D
I should know that
 A                Em   G
You're not gonna change


{CHORUS}
              D              
Cause you're hot then you're cold
        A
You're yes then you're no
        Em
You're in then you're out
        G
You're up then you're down
       D
You're wrong when it's right
     A
It's black and it's white
   Em
We fight, we break up
   G
We kiss, we make up
     D                          A
(you)You don't really want to stay, no
         Em                           G
(but you)But you don't really want to go-o
       D
You're hot then you're cold
       A
You're yes then you're no
       Em
You're in and you're out
       G
You're up and you're down


( BRIDGE )
G        D
Someone call the doctor
A
Got a case of a love bi-polar
G          D
Stuck on a roller coaster
A
Can't get off this ride

( STRUM SLOW OR PLUCK CHORDS )
D                 A
You change your mind
        Em             G
Like a girl changes clothes

You're up and you're down
