C                   G
Here at the bar who cares what I do
G7                    C
I'm all alone but I'm drinking for two
C                     G7
Drowning the man that I used to be
                      C
Nobody loves you like me

[1]
I won't sign a thing, or else if I do
I'll use a pencil and that will show you
How nothing lasts, how nothing is free
Nobody loves you like me

(C)         F                      C
I shouldn't stay, I think you'll agree
                 G                  C
It's no good for you, no better for me
                    F                  C
In the morning I'll go to a place far away
                 G7 C   Dm   G
Somewhere you'll ne-ver find me

[1]
I catch a look, a thing that you say
Out on the fire escape smoking all day
Missing someone, now who could it be
Nobody loves you like me

[2]
Noises outside, the trucks in the street
Will cover my flight, my hero's retreat
I'm supposed to feel bad but I don't anymore
          G     G7
Only when you remind me

[1]
Air in my lungs, a cough and a wheeze
Holes in the bellows and blood on the keys
You move along, there's nothing to see
Nobody loves you like me
Nobody loves you like me
