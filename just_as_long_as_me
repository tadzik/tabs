It's a sad and awful story and the shorter folks won't care

I'm a man who's simply way to big to love

Picture me a monster towering above

Chorus

C				G	
I don't care what color hair is growing on her head
                                  D
She doesn't have to be a sight to see
G                               C                G
It don't matter if she's fat or if she's good in bed
                       D               G
Just as long as she is just as long as me

Took an ad out in the paper with my picture and some prose
        G                             D
It said tall and lonely lover seeking same

Combed my hair and got a shave and bought a long stemmed thornless rose
        G              D               G
When my picture ran my head was out of frame

Every night I have a dream I'm on a mountain in the sky
        G                          D
And the air gets ever thinner as I climb
