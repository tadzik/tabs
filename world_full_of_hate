G                        C          Am
A feeling inside in the back of my head.
C
Like a song you still know from so long ago
G                        D
And I wouldn't change a thing.
G                                  C            Am
Like a car driving by triggers something in my mind
C                                        G              D
Am I retreiving my direction or just charging forward blind?
G                           C          Am
Am I every thing that you wanted me to be?
C                               G                  D
Have I lost that condition a conection I couldn't see?


G                                                     C                Am
Til the end like a friend stands by you again and I wouldn't change a thing
C                                                       G                 D
Toe to toe, friend or foe, it's all that I know and I wouldn't change a thing


C     D


G                                 C             Am
As the years pass us by, will I still make the grade?
C                                G                D
Can I really offer anything and will my soul be saved?
G                              C       Am
Can you cleanse me of...Drive out the swine? 
C                                  G                 D
Am I only falling farther can you keep me safe from harm?
G
The memories you build in the house on the hill
C                          Am
Would you really change a thing?
C                                             G              D
Corrected mistakes in a world full of hate, never changes anything.

Til the end, like a friend
C              Am
Stands by you again
C                           G               D
Toe to toe, friend or foe, it's all that I know


G                                                     C                Am
Til the end like a friend stands by you again and I wouldn't change a thing.
C                                                        G                D
