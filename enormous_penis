           G            B
Whenever life gets you down
             C       Cm
Keeps you wearing a frown
          D     C#       C       B  G
And the gravy train has left you behind
               G          B
And when your all out of hope
             C           Cm
Down at the end of your rope
       A                          D
And nobody's there to throw you a line

        C
If you ever get so low
                Cm
That you don't know which way to go
     G                         G7
Come on and take a walk in my shoes
       A
Never worry 'bout a thing
 A  B   C
Got the world on a string
            D                          
Cause I've got the cure for all of my blues (all of his blues)

                 G          B  Em
I take a look at my enormous penis
          C               D       G   G   F#   G
And my troubles start a-meltin' away (ba-doom bop)
                 G          B  Em
I take a look at my enormous penis
          A                       D
And the happy times are comin' to stay (be-doo)

         C
I got a sing and I dance
         Cm
When I glance in my pants
        G                        F#  Em
And a-feelin's like a sun shiny daaaaay
                 C          D  G   F# F  Em
I take a look at my enormous  Pee--e--e--nis
          C          D        G   G   F#   G
And a-everything is goin' my way (ba-doom bop)
