        F                          Am
I would give you the stars in the sky
                       G
But they're too far away
   F                          Am
If you were a hooker, you'd know
                  G
I'd be happy to pay
F                         Am
  If suddenly you were a guy
                  G
I'd be suddenly gay


          C        F         G
'Cause my heart belongs to you
   C        F          G
My love is pure and true
   C        F         G
My heart belongs to you
       F
But my cock is community property

You're the only girl that I like to screw
When I'm not on the road
When I come home, my dinner's made
And the front lawn is mowed
I'll kiss your mouth
Even after you swallow my load

'Cause my heart belongs to you
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do for you
My heart belongs to you
But my cock is community property

I wanna make it clear
So you retain it
My dick's a free spirit
And you can't restrain it
No, you just can't chain it down

(same chords with arpeggios)

I love you so much it hurts
From my head to my feet
I think of you when I can't
Help but fondle my meat
I see your face every time
That I go out and cheat
