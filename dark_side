I can have a dark side too

G                              F
I called my girlfriend up on the phone
             C                          G
I said, “Hey girlfriend what’s going wrong?”
G                              F
She said, “I’m breaking it off with you
              C              G
“I feel as if the magic has gone”
              Am                   C
I said, “Hey baby what’re you talking about?
      G                             D
“I thought that everything was just fine”
              Am               C
She said, “That’s exactly my point
              G                                  D

“I need somebody deeper than you
 C                                 D
“Someone with a little third-dimension”

I wrote a letter to Mr Sony
I said, “Hey Sony what’s going down?
“I’ve got a record and I reckon it’s wicked
“And I think you should s-spread it around”
He said, “Hey Tim, I quite like your work
“It’s clever and quirky
“But I promise you this
“You could be clever as Voltaire
“But it won’t get you nowhere
“If you wanna sell discs
“Clever never made no one rich
“It doesn’t appeal to the teenage market
“The teenage market!”

I said,
I can have a dark side
If you want me to
I can have a dark side
I can reveal my tortured internals
If pain’s what you want in an act
Pain I can do
I can have a dark side too
I can have a dark side

Em               D                    C
Daddy never came to my ball games
Where are you daddy?
Daddy never came to my ball games
He never loved me

I,
I can have a dark side
If you want me to
