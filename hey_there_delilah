F, Am, F, Am

VERSE 1
F                            Am
Hey there Delilah, What’s it like in New York City? 
      F                               Am
I’m a thousand miles away, But girl tonight you look so pretty, 
        Dm  A#                 C                  Dm
Yes you do, Time Square can’t shine as bright as you, 
             C
I swear it’s true. 
F                            Am
Hey there Delilah, Don’t you worry about the distance, 
          F                                  Am
I’m right there if you get lonely, Give this song another listen, 
           Dm    A#            C                Dm 
Close your eyes, Listen to my voice it’s my disguise, 
            C
I’m by your side. 

CHORUS
F                      Dm  F                      Dm
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
F                      Dm  F                      Dm            
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
               F
What you do to me. 

VERSE 2
F                         Am
Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard, 
           F                                    Am
But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar, 
              Dm    A#              C               Dm
We'll have it good, We'll have the life we knew we would, 
           C
My word is good. 
F                           Am   
Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much left to say, 
         F                                 Am
If every simple song I wrote to you, Would take your breath away, 
             Dm   A#            C                  Dm
I’d write it all, Even more in love with me you’d fall, 
             C
We’d have it all. 

CHORUS
F                      Dm  F                      Dm
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
F                      Dm  F                      Dm            
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 

Bridge
A#                                      C
A thousand miles seems pretty far, But they’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
F                                 Dm  
I’d walk to you if I had no other way 
A#                                         C
Our friends would all make fun of us, And we'll just laugh along because, 
   F                                     Dm
We know that none of them have felt this way, 
A#                               C            
Delilah I can promise you, That by the time that we get through, 
    Dm                                               C
The world will never ever be the same, And you’re to blame. 

VERSE 3
F                        Am
Hey there Delilah you be good, And don’t you miss me, 
         F                                         Am
Two more years and you’ll be done with school, And I'll be making history, 
Dm        A#                 C              Dm
Like I do, You’ll know it's all because of you, 
A#             C            Dm
We can do whatever we want to, 
A#           C               Dm                  C
Hey there Delilah here's to you, This one’s for you. 

FINAL CHORUS
F                      Dm  F                      Dm
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
F                      Dm  F                      Dm
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
               F
What you do to me. 
   Dm   F    Dm    F    Dm   F    Dm   F F
Ohhh
