A kiss is not a contract, but it's very nice

Mmmmm, very nice
G                          C
Just because you've been exploring my mouth
        D
Doesn't mean you get to take an expedition further south, no

Just because we've been playing tonsil hockey
        D
Doesn't mean you get to score the goal that's in my jockeys


Em                               D
Oh just because I'm in a two man novelty band

Em                                       D
You can take me out to dinner that might be quite nice

you could buy me a burrito and some beans and rice
                                  B
but that won't get you into pants paradise
     A
They call it a fly because it takes you up to heaven oh oh
