Am                       E
  I see a red door and I want it painted black.

Am                     E  
  No colours anymore I want them to turn black.

Am  G       C          G          Am
  I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes.

Am  G       C       G       D               E
  I have to turn my head un-til my darkness goes.



Verse 2

Am                         E     
  I see a line of cars and they're all painted black.

Am                              E
  With flowers and by love both never to come back.

Am  G          C          G         Am
  I see people turn their heads and quickly look away.

Am       G        C    G       D             E 
  Like a new born baby it just happens every day.



Verse 3

Am                         E
  I look inside myself and see my heart is black.

Am                        E
  I see my red door and I want it painted black.

Am      G         C      G       Am
  Maybe then I'll fade a-way and not have to face the facts.

Am         G    C      G       D                   E
  It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black.


Verse 4

Am                             E
  No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue.

Am                              E
  I could not forsee this thing happening to you.

Am   G      C      G        Am
  If I look hard e-nough in-to the setting sun

Am   G         C          G     D                E
  My love will laugh with me be-fore the morning comes.
